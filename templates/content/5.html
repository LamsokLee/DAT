            Many families want to know about their family member’s outlook (“prognosis”) and the possible long-term
            effects of TBI before making a decision on treatment.
        </p>
        <div class="info-box" role="alert">
            <div class="info-box-text"><b>It is important to note that:</b>
                <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a wide range of possible long-term effects after TBI</li>
                    <li>It is rare for doctors to be able to tell you for sure what the prognosis is</li>
                    <li>In most cases, there is a large degree of uncertainty</li>
                </ul>

        <p>this is because the prognosis depends on many factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Severity of the brain injury when it happened
            <li>Age of the person at the time of the injury
            <li>Health of the person before the brain injury
            <li>Status of the person’s memory and thinking ability before the brain injury
            <li>Blood pressure and oxygen levels of the person at the time of and right after the brain injury
            <li>Bleeding in the brain
            <li>Injuries to other organs (lung, belly, etc.)
            <li>Other complications in the icu (brain swelling, infections, etc.)
            <li>Ability and willingness of the person to overcome difficult times
            <li>Other unknown factors
        </ul>
