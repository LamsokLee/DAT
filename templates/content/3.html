                A mechanical ventilator is a breathing machine that provides artificial breathing support. The
                ventilator
                pumps air and oxygen into the lungs through a breathing tube. The breathing tube goes through the mouth
                into
                the windpipe.
                The ventilator keeps a patient breathing while he or she receives treatments for medical problems like
                TBI
                and other serious conditions.<br>
                <b>It is also called “life support.”</b>
                <b>The ventilator itself does not cure the injury.</b>
