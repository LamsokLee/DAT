<p>Your family member is still on a ventilator. Despite the best care from the doctors and nurses, he or she is
    unable to survive without the ventilator. </p><p>There are a number of reasons for this, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your family member is unconscious because of the brain injury, and the breathing tube is protecting the
        lungs from saliva or food going down the windpipe
    <li>Your family member has problems with the lungs themselves (lung infection, fluid on the lungs, or other
        condition)
    <li>Your family member has other issues, which the doctor can explain
        <br>
</ul>

        You have to decide which treatment goals best match your family memberâ€™s goals, values, and
        preferences.<br>
        The treatment goal that you choose will determine the procedures and type of care your family member
        receives
        while in the ICU and afterwards.
