    <p>Your family member is still on a ventilator. Despite the best care from the doctors and nurses, he or she is
        unable to survive without the ventilator. There are a number of reasons for this, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your family member is unconscious because of the brain injury, and the breathing tube is protecting the
            lungs from saliva or food going down the windpipe;
        <li>Your family member has problems with the lungs themselves (lung infection, fluid on the lungs, or other
            condition);
        <li>Your family member has other issues, which the doctor can explain.
            <br>
    </ul>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">At this point, you have to decide which of two treatment goals best
        aligns with your family memberâ€™s goals, values, and preferences.<br>
        The treatment goal that you choose will determine the procedures and type of care your family member receives
        while
        in the ICU and afterwards.
