    <p>Your family member is still on a ventilator. Despite the best care from the doctors and nurses, he or she is
        unable to survive without the ventilator. </p><p>There are a number of reasons for this, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your family member is unconscious because of the brain injury, and the breathing tube is protecting the
            lungs from saliva or food going down the windpipe
        <li>Your family member has problems with the lungs themselves (lung infection, fluid on the lungs, or other
            condition)
        <li>Your family member has other issues, which the doctor can explain
            <br>

        goals, values, and preferences.<br>

        while in the ICU and afterwards.</p>
