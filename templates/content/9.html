        <b>Why choose comfort as the treatment goal (“comfort care”)?</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The patient has gone through enough discomfort in the ICU at this point.
        <li>Has a brain injury so severe that the chance of survival is extremely low.
        <li>Has said in the past that (s)he would not want to endure the treatments necessary to be kept
            alive.
        <li>Has made it clear in the past that (s)he would not want a lower quality of life.
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>What happens when comfort is the treatment goal (“comfort care”)?</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the family is ready, the bedside team will safely and carefully discontinue medications, except those
            that
            prevent suffering.
        <li>Nurses experienced in providing comfort care will make sure your family member is not suffering; They will
            give
            medicines and nursing care to prevent pain and suffering, but they will do nothing to
            hasten the natural dying process.
        <li>The expert staff will discontinue IV fluids, artificial feeding, breathing tube, and ventilator—measures
            which
            are keeping your family member alive.
        <li>The patient will die, usually within hours to days after starting comfort care.
            Family members and friends can stay with the patient during this time.
    </ul>
