    <!--the paragraph in this page-->
    <p>
        Doctors and nurses will do whatever it takes to keep a person alive. Patients will require additional procedures
        to improve their chances of survival.

    </p><p>Patients usually need these two procedures:</p>

    <p>
        <u style="font-size: larger;font-weight: bolder">1. Tracheostomy (“trach”):</u>
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <p>For the first days after a major TBI, patients are not able to breathe on their own. They
            depend
            on
            a breathing tube placed through the mouth and hooked up to the ventilator. If patients are
            still
            unable to breathe on their own after several days, a procedure called a <b>tracheostomy</b>
            is
            done
            to
            avoid serious long-term damage to the windpipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a <b>tracheostomy</b>, a surgeon makes a hole in the front of the patient’s neck,
            allowing
            direct
            access to the windpipe. A shorter tube is placed through the hole, and the ventilator is
            hooked
            up
            to it. Over time most patients can slowly discontinue the ventilator, but they will keep the
            trach
            for several weeks to months. Once the ventilator is removed, the patient breathes oxygen or
            regular
            air through the trach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Patients can’t speak with a trach until their condition improves.</b>
            When a patient is well enough, a cap can be placed over the opening. Many but not all
            patients
            can
            have their trach removed after weeks or months. A small scar remains where the hole was.
        </p>

                This patient has a <b>tracheostomy (“trach”)</b>. On the left side is the trach without
                an
                oxygen
                mask; on the right side is the same patient with an oxygen mask (“trach mask”) through
                which
                he breathes oxygen or air. This patient is no longer on a ventilator.

    <p>
        <u style="font-size: larger;font-weight: bolder">2. Feeding Tube: (also called a “PEG” or “G-tube”)</u>
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="col-md-6">

            <p> A patient can’t eat by mouth when on a ventilator or with a trach. Therefore, a
                surgeon
                places a feeding tube through the skin directly into the stomach. Liquid nutrition
                and
                medications are administered through the feeding tube.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually, the trach and feeding tube
                surgeries are done at the same time. The feeding tube may stay in longer than the
                trach.
                In
                some cases, people may have to use a feeding tube permanently, if they don’t recover
                enough
                to eat on their own.

            <b>If your family member does not recover to the level you had hoped</b>, despite the highest level
            of
            care,
            you may decide to have the trach and feeding tube removed at that point and transition to comfort
            care.
