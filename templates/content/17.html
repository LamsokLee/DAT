    <p>
        Ms. Smith is a 35-year-old previously healthy woman who fell down the stairs. She is now unconscious. She was an
        avid runner. She was working full-time as an accountant. Because of her injury, she underwent surgery to remove
        blood from one area of her brain. She remains sleepy and confused during her ICU stay. She has a severe lung
        infection. Ms. Smith:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Is young and was healthy and active before her injury;
        </li>
        <li>
            Has a severe brain injury;
        </li>
        <li>
            Does not have any other injuries;
        </li>
        <li>
            Develops a major infection while in the ICU.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The doctor thinks that Ms. Smith won’t be able to breathe or eat on her own any time soon. The doctor expects
        that
        it’s highly likely she will survive for six months or longer. She will probably improve to some degree, but it
        is
        not certain she will ever be independent or work again. The doctor asks Ms. Smith’s parents to decide which
        goals of
        care best align with Ms. Smith’s values and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The parents filled out the worksheet to help them decide which goal of care was best for their daughter:

                It
                would make her mad. She has told me she would never want to be in a nursing home, not even for a few
                weeks, not even to try to get better. It makes me very sad to think about it, but I could never do this
                to her; I could never allow a trach or feeding tube as it would make her miserable. She’s a fighter, but
                not like this. If she can’t be like she was before, she would want to be comfortable and be in
                peace."</i>
