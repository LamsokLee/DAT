    <p>
        After the trach and feeding tube placements, your family member will need further medical care and
        rehabilitation at
        a facility specializing in care for people recovering from TBI. The doctor will decide when your family member
        is
        ready for this step. Your family member’s medical and nursing needs determine which type of facility they go to
        after the ICU.
    </p>
    <p>There are three(3) types of facilities where your family member may be sent:</p>
    <p>
        <u style="font-size: larger;font-weight: bolder">1. Acute Rehabilitation Hospital:</u>
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <p><b>Patients with serious TBIs rarely go here directly.</b> Patients who require a breathing
            machine
            or frequent suctioning through a trach, or are too sleepy cannot go here until their condition
            improves.</p>
        <p>
            The patients who transfer here are:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generally very stable and wide awake.
            <li>Able to take part in at least three hours of therapy per day for 5-7 days per week.
            <li>Able to participate in intense physical, occupational, and speech therapies.
            <li>Rreated here for several weeks.
        </ul>

                    <li>Are too ill to take part in several hours of therapy per day.
                    <li>Are less likely to transfer to a LTACH or an acute rehabilitation hospital, due to the
                        patient’s
                        dependence on others and the severity of the injury.
