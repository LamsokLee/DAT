        <p>
            Some people feel that their family member has gone through enough in the ICU at this point. Others may be
            too sick to have any chance of survival. Some have said before that they would not want to endure the things
            necessary to be kept alive. Or you know that your loved one would not want a lower quality of life after the
            TBI.
        <p>
            When <b>comfort</b> is the treatment goal:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The bedside team will provide the safe and careful removal of medications (other than those preventing
                suffering). IV fluids, artificial feeding and machines, including the breathing tube and ventilator,
                which are keeping your loved one alive will also be stopped. This is done when the family is ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                The patient usually dies within a day to several days afterward.
            </li>
            <li>
                The patient will get medicines and nursing care to prevent pain and suffering, but the natural dying
                process will not be hastened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Family members and friends can stay with their loved ones during this time.
            </li>
        </ul>
