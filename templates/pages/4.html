<br>
<ul>
    <li>Your family member is still on a ventilator. Despite the best care from the doctors and nurses, he or she is
        unable
        to survive without the ventilator.
    <li>There are a number of reasons for this, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>Your family member is unconscious because of the brain injury, and the breathing tube is protecting the
                lungs from saliva or food going down the windpipe;
            <li>Your family member has problems with the lungs themselves (lung infection, fluid on the lungs, or other
                condition);
            <li>Your family member has other issues, which the doctor can explain.
        </ul>
    <li><b>At this point, you have to decide which of two treatment goals best aligns with your family member’s goals,
        values, and preferences.</b>

</ul>

<br><p>The treatment goal that you choose will determine the procedures and type of care your family member
    receives while in the ICU and afterwards.

<div class="section-head"><h3 class="text-center">WHAT ARE THE TWO TREATMENT GOALS?</h3>
</div>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>One treatment goal is your family member’s <b>survival, <i>no matter what it takes.</i></b>
    <li>The other treatment goal is making your family member <b>as comfortable as possible</b>, so he or she <b><i>does
        not suffer.</i></b>
</ol>
