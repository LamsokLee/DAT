            <p>
                Ms. Smith is a 35-year-old previously healthy woman who injured her head when she fell down the stairs. She is now unconscious. She is an avid runner. She is currently working full-time as an accountant. Because of her injury, she undergoes surgery to remove the blood from one area of her brain. She remains sleepy and confused during her ICU stay. She does not have any other major ICU problems during her stay. Ms. Smith:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is relatively young, healthy and active
                </li>
                <li>
                    Has a treatable brain injury
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not have any other injuries
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does not have major problems like infection, high blood pressure, or seizures while in the hospital
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The doctor thinks that Ms. Smith won’t be able to breathe or eat on her own any time soon. The doctor expects that her chance of surviving until 6 months and beyond is very high. She will probably improve to some degree, but it is not sure she will ever be independent and work as an accountant again. The doctor asks the parents to help decide which goals of care best align with Ms. Smith’s values and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an example of how the parents may fill out the worksheet to help them decide about which general goal of care is best for their daughter:

              <div class="panel-body" style="font-style: italic">“Overall the doctor thinks that she may improve, although there is a lot of uncertainty here. She will definitely need some form of LTACH or nursing home after the ICU, and then hopefully rehabilitation later. She will definitely need a trach and feeding tube before then. We understand the pros and cons of both options: survival or comfort care.”</div>
            </div>

              <div class="panel-body" style="font-style: italic">“Our daughter had a high school classmate before with a TBI and she knows what a trach/feeding tube look like. She was not opposed to it as long as she has a chance of getting rid of it. We know our daughter; she is a runner and has run marathons. This will be even longer than training for a marathon, but she will want to give it a try.”</div>

            <div class="panel panel-primary">
              <div class="panel-heading">4) What questions do you need answered before you can decide?</div>
              <div class="panel-body" style="font-style: italic">“We have a few questions regarding the procedures themselves and how to get her to the next level of care after the ICU. We have written down the questions and are meeting with the doctor to get them answered. We know that the Social Worker and Case manager will talk to us about what the next steps are regarding finding a place for after the ICU and acute care hospital.”</div>

            <div class="panel panel-primary">
              <div class="panel-heading">5) Imagine a line where the right side is comfort care and the left side is doing everything possible for survival. Where do you think your loved one would put themselves on the line below?</div>
              <div class="panel-body" style="font-style: italic">“We are leaning towards continuing advanced medical care and going forward with the trach and feeding tube and what follows after the ICU stay. We know it’s going to be a long, painful road ahead, but we know our daughter’s endurance and will power. She would accept a lower quality of life and keep fighting to make the best of her life.”</div>
