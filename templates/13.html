        <p>
            Your family member is too sick to make his/her own medical decisions. Therefore, someone close to them like
            you must do it – you are the one most likely to know what he/she would want.
        <p>
            <b>Your job is to make the decision your loved one would want</b> if they could talk to us.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
            Your job is <u>not</u> to make the decision that <u>you</u> want.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Consider these things</b> when making this important decision for your loved one:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What kind of person were they before the injury? What did they like to do? What were they able to do?
                What if they can’t go back to their normal quality of life? Would they be happy?
            </li>
            <li>
                Think about what your loved one would want:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Some people know that their loved one would not want to be dependent on others (short or
                        long-term), or would not want a trach or feeding tube.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may have never talked about these things. Still, it is important to think about
                        conversations you may have had with your loved one about similar issues. Have they ever been
                        around someone who has had a brain injury or stroke, or trach and feeding tube?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
