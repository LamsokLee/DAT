            Example of how the IMPACT-model may use a patient’s information to estimate the outlook at six months after
            the injury
        </p>
        <p>
            58 year-old patient with traumatic brain injury presents with both pupils reactive to light, normal oxygen
            level at the accident scene but with low blood pressure at the accident scene, with head CT showing “diffuse
            injury grade 2”, and traumatic subarachnoid blood, but no epidural blood on CT, and extensor posturing on
            the motor exam on admission.

                Even with this model, there remains a large amount of uncertainty in many patients. Your loved one’s

            There are two different treatment goals that you will be asked to choose between. One treatment goal is
            survival of your loved one, no matter what it takes. The other goal is maximizing comfort for your loved
            one, so that they do not suffer.
