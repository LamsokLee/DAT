        <p>
            Family members like you have told us that examples of other patients and their families are helpful to them
            for understanding the choices.
        <p>
            We will now take a look at two patient examples, who are in the ICU for treatment of their brain injury.
            These two patients have many differences. Their families will have to think about these differences when
            making a decision about the goal of care (survival or comfort).
        </p>
        <p>
            As you read these examples, try to think about what your family member might want in each situation.
