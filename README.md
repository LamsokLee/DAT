# Decistion Aid Tool for msTBI

## Background
The goal of this project was to develop a web-based decision aid tool for the families of patients suffering from moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) by applying a user-centered iterative design approach. We conducted user studies with 6 wild-type families and evaluated usability of the decision aid based on user experience and humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) research methods.
