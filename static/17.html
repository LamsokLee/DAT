            <!--the paragraph in this page-->
            <p>
                Mr. Alvarez is a 76-year-old man with diabetes who was struck by a car while crossing the road. He has many areas of bleeding located deep inside his brain, and is in a coma. He also has a broken leg and many broken ribs. One of his broken ribs has injured his lungs. While in the hospital, he gets an infection in his lungs (pneumonia). Mr. Alvarez:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is an older man with some chronic medical problems, which are controlled
                </li>
                <li>
                    Has a complicated brain injury
                </li>
                <li>
                    Has other injuries to his body, including his lungs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Has an infection while in the hospital
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The doctor thinks that Mr. Alvarez won’t be able to breathe or eat on his own any time soon, if ever. The doctor expects that his chance of surviving 6 months is low. He may improve to some degree, but will probably never be independent again. Whether he may go home ever again is unclear. It’s unlikely because he lives alone, and his children have their own families and jobs and won’t be able to look after him all day long. The doctor asks the daughter to help decide which goals of care best align with Mr. Alvarez’s values and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an example of how the daughter may fill out the worksheet to help her decide about which general goal of care is best for her father:

Now, his quality of life would be much much lower. Without his chess or cooking he would not want to just be alive. He would not want to go on with the outlook to be dependent on others.”</div>
